**Business Logic:**

1.  **Product Management:**

    -   Add a new product to the inventory.
    -   Update product details such as name, description, price, and quantity.
    -   Remove a product from the inventory.
2.  **Stock Management:**

    -   Receive new stock for a product.
    -   Deduct stock when a product is sold.
    -   Set reorder points to automatically notify when stock is low.
3.  **Supplier Management:**

    -   Add, update, or remove supplier information.
    -   Associate products with suppliers.
4.  **Order Management:**

    -   Create purchase orders for restocking.
    -   Track order status (pending, delivered, etc.).
    -   Deduct stock upon order fulfillment.
5.  **Reporting:**

    -   Generate inventory reports (e.g., stock levels, low stock items).
    -   Analyze sales data and product performance.

**UML Class Diagram:**

Here's a simplified UML class diagram for the Inventory Management System:

In this simplified diagram:

-   `Product` represents the products in the inventory.
-   `Supplier` represents the suppliers that provide products to the inventory.
-   `StockTransaction` tracks the stock changes (receipts and deductions).
-   `PurchaseOrder` represents a purchase order made to suppliers.
-   `OrderItem` represents individual items within a purchase order.
